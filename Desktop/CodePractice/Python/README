In order for the application to work, it will ask for user input that should be formatted as follows:
  1 Worded City + State -----> "<City>,<State>"                    IE: "Chicago,Illinois"
  
  2 Worded City + State -----> "<CityPart1 CityPart2>,<State>" --- IE: "San Diego,California"


One benefit too is that if you search the API link in your browser (as formatted in the Pyton code), you can actually see the format of the JSON file. If the user wants to
incorporate more information to be given to display, the user can parse and grab from the JSON category of interest.
